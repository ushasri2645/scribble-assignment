# Quickstart: Secret Word Drawer

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Backend and frontend dependencies installed

## Run the app

1. Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. Start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open the frontend in a browser and use two tabs or windows to simulate the
   drawer and a guesser.

## Manual validation checklist

1. Create a room and confirm the creator becomes the drawer for the first
   round.
2. Join the same room from a second tab and confirm both players share the
   same room snapshot.
3. Start the round from the host tab and confirm the selected word comes from
   the starter list.
4. Confirm the drawer sees the secret word and the second tab does not.
5. Try blank or whitespace-only player names and confirm they are rejected
   with a clear error.

## Notes

- The backend stores room state in memory, so restarting it clears active
  rooms.
- Room snapshots are expected to vary by viewer so the drawer can see the
  secret word while guessers cannot.
- The selected word is deterministic for the round start, which keeps the
  feature easy to test.
